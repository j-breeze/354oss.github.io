//Faster, saves data! :)
//Uses Stamen layers for the background (see leaflet-providers.js for more background layer options). Only using Terrain and Toner for now. 
//Some others are CONUS-only and others like watercolor don't always load well. But you can get all sorts of background map layers online!

const newObsGroup = L.layerGroup();

//This sets the boundaries and zoom for the map. Limited it to Alaska.
//maxZoom sets how far you can zoom in. minZoom sets how far you can zoom out!
//minZoom helps limit view to Alaska. maxZoom helps prevent super high res images from loading, 
//and super zoomed in terrain often doesn't load correctly anyway. (404 errors, doubt the database has images!)
//maxBounds will pull the user back to the map if they try to scroll outside the set Lat/Longs.
//layers tells Leaflet which map layers to toggle 'on' by default on page load. Layer names are further down in code.

//This is where the script pulls the data from Synoptic (parent company of MesoWest). The URL defines the parameters of what is pulled.
//Typical format is &[parameter]=[thing]. For instance, &units=metric sets the returned unit values to metric.
//https://developers.synopticdata.com/mesonet/explorer/ lets you customize what the API delivers and gives you a custom URL automatically!
//This link only allows 5,000 accesses per month for free, may need subscription? If data is not pulling, paste URL into web browser to see 
//if appears. The "token" is linked to my Synoptic account (jresenbeck) and unique. Needed to access data. 
//If it breaks at any point, make your own account and get your own token.
